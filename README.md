## ðŸ”¹ What This Does

Chase: LEDs turn on one by one from left â†’ right.

Bounce: LEDs go left â†’ right â†’ left.

Blink: All LEDs blink together.

## ðŸ”¹ Why Static?

The LED pins (pins[]) are shared by all light modes â†’ so we use static properties/methods.

We donâ€™t need multiple RunningLights objects. Instead, we treat it like a utility class.
